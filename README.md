# Make It Rain (Android)

Let me say this up front: There is no clear business case for this app. It
serves no particular purpose other than entertainment.

With that being said, I had a lot of fun building this app, and I think it's a
pretty cool idea, even though I've never been to a nightclub or thrown any
large amount of money in the air.

I'm a fan of open source software, so you'll see that this app is completely
free and open source (and now ad-free).

Cheers.
