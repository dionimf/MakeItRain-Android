# Make It Rain (Android)

Let me say this up front: This app is entirely built to generate income for me.
There is no clear business case for this app, it serves no particular purpose
other than entertainment, and it monetizes a completely unnecessary activity.

With that being said, I had a lot of fun building this app, and I think it's a
pretty cool idea, even though I've never been to a nightclub or thrown any
large amount of money in the air.

I'm a fan of open source software, so you'll see that this app is completely
free and open source, and that I've provided signed builds that are completely
ad-free for those diligent enough to find this project.

Cheers.
